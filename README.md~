Use the following command to run the script:
../waf --run "wifitcpm3 --n=30 --rtsCts=150"

n: number of node
rtsCts: RtsCtsThreshold. Set it lower than 1024 to use RTS/CTS.

To run it automatically (for example, if you want to run it several times, each with different number of nodes) use shell script.
